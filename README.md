## Installation

#### With `git`

From the root of your Hugo site, clone the theme into `themes/hugo-vitae` by running :
```
git clone https://github.com/3ld0ct0r/hugo-vitae.git themes/hugo-vitae
```

#### Manual

1. [Download][zip-archive] zip archive.
2. Unarchive it.
3. Move `hugo-vitae` folder in `themes` folder of your site

For more information read the official [setup guide][hugo-guide] of Hugo.

## Quick start

After installation, take a look in the `exampleSite` folder at. This directory contains an example config file and the content for the demo. It serves as an example setup for your documentation. Edit the site attributes in `config.toml and edit the various entries in `layouts/partials/.

```
  exampleSite
  ├── config.toml
  ├── data
  │     ├── education.yml
  │     ├── employment.yml
  │     ├── hobbies.yml
  │     ├── initiatives.yml
  │     └── skills.yml
  └── static
        └── img
             └── profile.png
```

Copy at least the `config.toml` in the root directory of your website. Overwrite the existing config file if necessary.

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -
very handy. Spin it up with the following command:

``` sh
hugo serve
```

Now you can go to [localhost:1313][local] and the Vitae
theme should be visible.
